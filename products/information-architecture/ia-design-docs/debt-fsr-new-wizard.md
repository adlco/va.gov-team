## <a name="pagestructure"></a>Page Structure

We will update the 'Manage VA Debt' page to point to several different static, drupal-managed pages with information about debt help.

We will be creating a new static, drupal-managed page about requesting help for education, pension, and disability overpayment debt, and that page will link to the debt help form 5655. It will live in Resources and Support, because it is auxillary content to the benefit.

Up-to-date diagram can be found on [mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1682537441750/a9937e9953d80c221c5165131f611026e0419c7b?sender=ua67f17f1c416a96ea04d2476) (see Version 3). Note that this team initially considered a subtask component for an outdated wizard, but decided on a content-first approach instead. The previous iterations of this solution can be found in V1 and V2 in the mural above.
