Janelle Finnerty, janelle.finnerty\@oddball.io


## **Background**

Create a high-quality accessible service or suite of services within VA.gov to serve Veterans in finding and managing their accredited representatives (Power of Attorney (POA)) and to support the deprecation of the legacy systems used to take those actions.

### **2024 OCTO Priorities**

### **Veteran Journey**

Veterans, their family members, and caregivers can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting claims. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

Full [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for reference.


## **Research Goals**

- Evaluate usability of Appoint a Representative on VA.gov. Usability includes understandability of content, whether the experience meets user expectations, and identifying system bugs.

- _Stretch goal:_ Evaluate usability of the Representative Status Widget on VA.gov.


### **Outcome**

- User testing of Appoint a Representative and the Representative Status Widget on VA.gov will help the team to identify and fix any outstanding user pain points and system bugs in the experience.


### **Research questions**

1. Are there any usability challenges with the Appoint a Representative feature?

   1. Do users understand the information shown?

      1. Is there any information missing?

   2. Are there any challenges with using the experience?

      1. Is there any confusion with the ‘Street address line 2’ input?

   3. Does the experience meet user expectations?

   4. Are the steps clear and actionable?

   5. Are assistive technology (AT) users able to successfully use the feature?

2. _Stretch goal:_ Are there any usability challenges with the Representative Status Widget?

   1. Same additional questions as above.


### **Hypothesis**

1. Veterans will be able to successfully navigate Appoint a Representative through tested patterns and informative content.

2. Veterans will clearly understand whether the process concludes with a PDF or digital submission, as well as the next steps to take upon completion.

3. Veterans will find value in signing in to see their current representative.

4. If signed-in, Veterans will expect their information to be pre-filled in the form.


## **Methodology**

- **Warm-up questions /** The moderator will ask the Veteran a short series of questions to understand their current status with finding a representative and VA.gov engagement.

- **Usability testing** / Users will be asked to complete the Appoint a Representative flow on VA.gov and provide feedback along the way.


### **Location**

Remote on Zoom


### **Research materials**

- WIP Link to conversation guide


## **Recruitment**

### **Recruitment approach**

Our target audience are 12 Veterans (with expectations of speaking to 8) who are actively searching for a VSO, with a split of AT and non-AT users.


### **Recruitment criteria**

#### **Requesting a kick-off call**

- WIP Enter dates and times for kick-off call

- Prior to their session we request that Perigean:

  - Confirms AT participants will use the AT they indicated in their screener survey.
