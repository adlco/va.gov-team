## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward an omnichannel experience and multilingual content, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about representatives. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

## Related terminology

**accredited representative**

We use this term to refer to a person or organization who's authorized to help someone with their VA claim or application. An accredited representative can be 1 of 3 types: Veteran Service Organization (VSO) or VSO representative, claims agent, or attorney. For an accredited representative to sign for someone else, the claimant or the representative must submit VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a. Use "VA accredited representative" in the first instance. After that, "accredited representative" is OK. Lowercase, and define on first appropriate instance as “a person or organization who's authorized to help someone with their VA claim or application.” Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. 

**alternate signer**

We use this term for a person who's certified to sign certain VA forms or applications for someone else. A person can certify as an alternate signer by submitting VA Form 21-0972.

**fiduciary**

We use this term for a person with legal permission to receive benefit payments and make financial decisions on behalf of a Veteran. 

**power of attorney**

We use this term for the legal document that gives someone the permission to act on behalf of a Veteran in specific circumstances. We say that a person “has power of attorney” to describe their legal permissions. We don’t say that a person “is a power of attorney.” The scope of the legal authority depends on the type of power of attorney.  

Here are some types of power of attorney and related VA forms:
- “Durable power of attorney for health care” is permission to make health care decisions on behalf of a Veteran. 
  - VA Form 10-0137 gives this permission.

- “Power of attorney for VA purposes” is limited permission for accredited representatives to communicate with VA on behalf of a Veteran in the context of benefit applications. 
  - VA Form 21-22 gives this permission for VSOs (and VSO representatives)
  - VA Form 21-22a gives this permission for accredited attorneys and claims agents

**third-party representative**

We use this general term for any person or organization with permission to act and communicate with VA on behalf of a Veteran. This includes accredited representatives, people with legal power of attorney, and fiduciaries. In most cases, we need to use more specific terms to describe the permissions a person has.

**Veterans Service Organization (VSO)** 

We use this term for organizations accredited by VA to help someone with their VA claim or application. We no longer use the term “Veterans Service Officer.” You can use “VSO representative” after spelling out the acronym VSO once on a page.

**Veterans Service Organization (VSO) representative** 

We use this term for individual representatives who belong to an accredited Veterans Service Organization (VSO). We no longer use the term “Veterans Service Officer.” You can use “VSO representative” after spelling out the acronym VSO once on a page.

### Retired terms 

**Veterans Service Officer (VSO)** or **Veterans Service Representative (VSR)**

Use “Veterans Service Organization representative” or “VSO representative.” VA’s Office of General Counsel accredits the organization, not the individual.
